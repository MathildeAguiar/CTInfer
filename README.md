### Context

This project takes place in Mathilde Aguiar's PhD started on October 1st 2023 funded by the 80|PRIME CNRS grant. 

## CTInfer

**Natural language Inference** (NLI) is the task where a model is aiming to determine if there is an entailment between a premise and an hypothesis, by identifying evidences within the premise.

In a clinical context, NLI can be used in different ways such as determining if a person is eligible to participate or not to a clinical trial. 

In a first part our study aims to tackle the gaps and challenges for NLI in the clinical domain. Then we will develop and explore different solutions to solve this task by releasing datasets, models, systems and performing evaluations. 

## Future Work
